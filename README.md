## 🎮 Overview

The **Green Light Game** challenges players to click as fast as possible once the screen turns green. If you click too early, you lose. If you click after it turns green, your **reaction time is displayed** in milliseconds.

This project is a fun way to showcase:
- GUI programming using **Tkinter**
- Event-driven logic
- Randomized timers
- Real-time feedback and display

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** (built-in GUI library)

## 📝 How to Play

1. Run the game.  
2. Click **Start** — the screen will turn red.  
3. Wait patiently 👀 — after a random delay, the screen will turn **green**.  
4. As soon as it turns green, **click anywhere** to test your reaction speed.  
5. If you click early, you’ll be notified. If you click on time, your reaction time will be shown.
