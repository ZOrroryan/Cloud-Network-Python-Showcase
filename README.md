## 🎮 Overview

The **Green Light Game** challenges players to click as fast as possible once the screen turns green. If you click too early, you lose. If you click after it turns green, your **reaction time is displayed** in milliseconds.

This project is a fun way to showcase:
- GUI programming using **Tkinter**
- Event-driven logic
- Randomized timers
- Real-time feedback and display
