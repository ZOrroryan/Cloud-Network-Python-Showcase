# 🟢 Green-Light-Game

A simple Python game built with Tkinter that tests the player’s reaction time when the light turns green. Designed to demonstrate GUI development skills and event-driven programming.

---

## 🎮 Overview

The **Green Light Game** challenges players to click as fast as possible once the screen turns green. If you click too early, you lose. If you click after it turns green, your **reaction time is displayed** in milliseconds.

This project is a fun way to showcase:
- GUI programming using **Tkinter**
- Event-driven logic
- Randomized timers
- Real-time feedback and display

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** (built-in GUI library)

---

## 📝 How to Play

1. Run the game.  
2. Click **Start** — the screen will turn red.  
3. Wait patiently 👀 — after a random delay, the screen will turn **green**.  
4. As soon as it turns green, **click anywhere** to test your reaction speed.  
5. If you click early, you’ll be notified. If you click on time, your reaction time will be shown.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

## 🚀 Run the Game Yourself

If you want to try the game on your own computer or in any Python environment, you can use the **`importtkinterastk.py`** file in this repository.  

1. Open the file in your favorite Python editor (like **VS Code**, **PyCharm**, or **IDLE**).  
2. Copy all the code from the file.  
3. Paste it into a new Python file (for example, `game.py`).  
4. Run the file with Python 3, and the Tkinter game window will open.  

> 💡 Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python, so no extra libraries are needed.
